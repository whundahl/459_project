1. <a href="https://ruddra.com/docker-django-nginx-postgres/">Deploy Django, Gunicorn, NGINX, Postgresql using Docker</a>
2. <a href="https://ruddra.com/serve-static-files-by-nginx-from-django-using-docker/">Serve Static Files by Nginx from Django using Docker</a>
3. <a href="https://ruddra.com/docker-do-stuff-using-celery-using-redis-as-broker/">Docker: Use Celery in Django(Redis as Broker)</a>

Where it is described how this boilerplate was created from scratch so that you can build your own.
